## Tools & Code Style

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommanded to be the default code editor. To ensure the consistency of code style, it is recommanded to use `Pylint` and `Black` as default formatters for Python development and `Prettier` VS Code plugin as the default formatter for JavaScript and JSX development.

Run the following command to install `Pylint` and `Black`:

```sh
pip install black pylint
```

In general, if you are usng VS Code, add the following snippet into `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
  "python.formatting.provider": "black",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "[javascript]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  },
  "[javascriptreact]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  }
}
```
